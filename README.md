# NeighborAid

NeighborAid is a web application that helps people living in the same neighborhood connect with their neighbors, track their emergency preparedness resources, and share what they have with others.

## Overview

NeighborAid is built around the idea that neighborhoods are stronger and safer when residents know what resources are available around them before an emergency happens. The app provides a shared space where neighbors can see who has critical supplies and how they can support each other.

Key goals of NeighborAid:

- Encourage **connection** between neighbors around preparedness instead of waiting for a crisis.
- Make it easy to **inventory** emergency resources (food, water, tools, medical supplies, skills, etc.).
- Support **sharing** and coordination so shortages and surpluses can be balanced within the neighborhood.

## Core Features

- Personal neighbor profiles describing households, contact preferences, and relevant skills.
- Resource tracking for items like first aid kits, generators, fuel, water, and non-perishable food.
- Neighborhood-level view to see which resources are covered and where gaps exist.
- Sharing and lending workflows that let neighbors offer resources to one another during emergencies or drills.
- Simple, web-based interface intended for use on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Use Cases

- A neighborhood preparedness group wants a shared, always-available inventory of critical supplies.
- Individual residents want to know what they can rely on nearby if they run out of something during a disaster.
- Community leaders want to identify preparedness gaps and organize group efforts to fill them.

## Project Status

NeighborAid is an active project and still evolving. Feedback, ideas, and suggestions for new preparedness or sharing features are welcome.
